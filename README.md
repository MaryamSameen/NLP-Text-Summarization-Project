# NLP-Text-Summarization-Project

This repository contains the code and resources for an NLP-based text summarization project. The goal of this project is to develop both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques to generate concise summaries of large text documents.

Files in the Repository
text_summarization.py: Python script containing the code for both extractive and abstractive summarization.
README.md: This file, containing an overview of the project.

Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
numpy
pandas
nltk
transformers
You can install them using pip:
pip install numpy pandas nltk transformers

Usage
Run the TextSummarization.py script to perform both extractive and abstractive summarization on the provided text data. The script performs the following steps:

Extractive Summarization:

Tokenizes the text into sentences.
Computes word frequencies excluding stop words.
Scores sentences based on word frequencies.
Selects the top n sentences with the highest scores to form the summary.

Abstractive Summarization:
Uses a pre-trained transformer model from the transformers library to generate an abstractive summary of the text.

Output
The script outputs the following:

Extractive Summary: A summary generated by selecting and concatenating the most important sentences from the text.
Abstractive Summary: A summary generated by a pre-trained transformer model, which rephrases the content to create a concise summary.
